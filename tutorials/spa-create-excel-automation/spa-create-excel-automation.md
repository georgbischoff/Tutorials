### About Excel SDK


The Excel SDK is a collection of activities allowing you to create automations using Microsoft Excel.
It comes with rich set of functionality. For ex,

- Create new excel Workbook
- Create new excel Worksheet
- Read and write data from an excel sheet, for a given data range
- Apply Filter on the a column
- etc

To design your automation, you will need an excel file filled with the sales orders data. You have the possibility to create it yourself using the below sample data:

| Order Number| Order Amount | Order Date | Shipping Country         | Expected Delivery Date | Order Status
|  :----------| :------------|:-----------| :------------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------

or you can use an excel sample of your choice


### Using Excel Link in your Excel Automations


1.  From the SAP Process Automation Lobby, create a new automation project.
2.  Provide appropriate name to your SPA project and relevant automations
3.  Select your active desktop agent version to be used during design and development of your automation.
4.  By Default Excel and Core SDK are added to the automations and your automation opens in a new browser tab. We have couple of ways to read excel Data.
      - Using the activity **Excel Cloud Link** to achieve Excel Data Mapping
      - Traditional step by step approach to read / write excel data

      In this tutorial, you will explore both ways of exploring excel data.

      **What is Excel Data Mapping?**

      Excel Data Mapping allows you to transform columns-based data from an Excel sheet into datatype that can be used in your automation. The data from the Excel sheet stays the same but the structure becomes a data type structure, making it possible to use throughout your project.

5.  As a first step, Locate and add **Open Excel Instance** activity to the automation flow
    <!-- border -->![Add Open Excel Instance](01-AddOpenExcelInstance.png)

6.  Similarly locate and add **Excel Cloud Link** from the activity pane
    <!-- border -->![Add Excel Cloud Link](02-AddExcelCloudLink.png)

7.  Now we will edit the properties of **Excel Cloud Link** activity. In the flow chart, select the excel cloud link activity, on the right side menu, click **Edit Activity** button
    <!-- border -->![Edit Excel Cloud Activity](03-ExcelLinkEditActivity.png)

8.  Within the edit activity screen, you can either use the file picker or Drag and drop your test excel.
    <!-- border -->![Import Excel](04-ExcelCloudLink_AddExcel.png)

9.  You can see, the excel cloud link capabilities, it already pre-selects the first sheet, it groups data by column names, it also finds out in few seconds the complete range of the excel
    <!-- border -->![Browse the data](05-ExcelData.png)

10. While excel cloud link is great in processing the data, it still needs for runtime reference, the path of your excel. Typically we need the full path of the excel. i.e. `folder path + file name`. Please provide your full path location into the path field.
    <!-- border -->![Provide excel path](06-ExcelCloudLink_pasteExcelPath.png)

11. SAP Process Automation has data type functionality to logically group and process your data. You can create a data type out of the added excel by using the excel data structure (2)
    <!-- border -->![Create Data type out of excel](07-ExcelCloudLink_AddExcel.png)

12. Provide a data type name, As you can see **Excel Cloud Link** already identifies field names using the first row of each column in your excel and determines the field type based on the type of data present in each column below the first row.
    <!-- border -->![Provide Data type](08-ExcelCloudLink_DataType.png)

13. All that **Excel Cloud Link** does is, it is a helper function to read given range of data in your excel. this will be returned through the **Output Parameter**. If you prefer you can edit output parameter name on the right side
    <!-- border -->![Edit Output Parameter](09-EditOutputParameter.png)

14. Now we will see the benefit of using excel cloud link by printing output parameters. For this we will use a loop variable **For Each**  
    <!-- border -->![Add For Each](10-AddForEach.png)

15. As a loop variable, you can add the **Output Parameter** from **Excel Cloud Link** activity
    <!-- border -->![Add Loop Variable](11-AddLoopVariable.png)

16. We will print customer name. let us add **Log Message**. if you are using the sample data provided in this tutorial you can print **Order Number**
    <!-- border -->![Add Log Message](12-AddLogMessage.png)

17. Initially we will add **Customer.name**
    <!-- border -->![Add Customer Name](13-AddCustomerName.png)

18. At first it takes 0-th index. But we wanted to use **index** variable so for each loop iteration, it can print the corresponding value
    <!-- border -->![Add Loop Index to the string](14-AddIndex.png)

19. We will now add **Close Excel Instance** as we added **Open Excel Instance** in the first step
    <!-- border -->![Add Close Excel Instance](14-1-AddCloseExcelInstance.png)

20. Now you can test the output after saving the project.

In the next step, we will take a more traditional approach to process the excel data.



### Process Excel Data


1. Let us start by adding new automation to our project and add **Open Excel Instance** to the flow.
  <!-- border -->![Add Open Excel Instance](16-AddOpenExcelInstance.png)

2. We will create couple of string variables to create base folder and file name. from the activity search for **String** and add it to the flow
  <!-- border -->![Create String Variables FolderPath & FileName](17-CreateStringVariable.png)

3. One of the Variable will point to the base `folder path` and the second variable will point to the `file name`. Creating them in this form, helps to use it in subsequent activity types.
  <!-- border -->![Create String Variables FolderPath & FileName](18-Created2VariableNames.png)

4. We will also call **Get File Name** activity to fetch the fileName. you can avoid this by creating a string variable for the file name
  <!-- border -->![Get Excel File Name](19-AddGetFileName.png)

5. We will add **Open Workbook** activity and point it to the full path (folder + file name) of the test excel file. This will open the specific excel file.
  <!-- border -->![Add Open Workbook](20-AddOpenWorkbook.png)

6. Subsequently we will activate the workbook and the first worksheet. Input for the activate work book activity is the file name from the previous step and the input of the activate worksheet activity is the first sheet name. You can use variables or hard coded values for now. If you are trying a different excel, use these values appropriately
  <!-- border -->![Activate Worksheet](21-ActivateWorkbookWorksheet.png)

7. Now that excel sheet is open, you can apply filters, hide columns or get values from a range of cells or add a new sheet and copy a range of values to the newly created sheet.
  <!-- border -->![Activate Worksheet](22-ActivateWorkbookWorksheet.png)

8. You can add **Get Values (Cells)** to fetch specific range cells and subsequently you can validate the step using output parameter through `LogMessage`. The input to **Get Values (Cells)** can be a single cell or a range of excel cells. When you use **Excel Cloud Link**, reading excel data is pretty quick and simple. the traditional approach is in few steps.
  <!-- border -->![Add Get All Values](23-AddGetAllValues.png)

9.  Now Add **Filter Range** activity. In the **Filter Range**, we will specify the data range, where the filter needs to be applied, along with the column on which the filter needs to apply with a filter condition.
We will now add a new excel sheet to your workbook and copy this filtered data onto that. just for demonstration purpose.
    <!-- border -->![Add Filter Range](24-FilterColumn.png)

    > In the sample project used in this tutorial, we used one more filter range expression, you may do it. In real world, this  depends on your logic to process the excel data

10. Subsequently you can add Hide column to hide a specific column in the result
    <!-- border -->![Add Hide Column](25-AddHideColumns.png)

11. Now we can copy the result of filter to a new sheet. For this we will first add a sheet through **Add Worksheet**  We will give it a name **Result**
    <!-- border -->![Add a New Worksheet](26-AddAddWorksheet.png)

12. This will activate the new worksheet, but for us to copy from the filter results to this new sheet, we will switch to the first sheet and copy its values.
    <!-- border -->![Activate original sheet](27-ActivateBackFirstSheet.png)

13. We will add **Copy Range** activity and provide the source range, destination worksheet and workbook and starting cell for copy.
    <!-- border -->![Add Copy Range](28-AddCopyRange.png)

14. We will activate the new sheet now, in order to save it
    <!-- border -->![Activate Result Sheet](29-AddActivateWorksheet4Result.png)

15. Now add **Save As Workbook** to save the new sheet as another file. You have option to save workbook as an excel file or CSV file. for this tutorial, I am saving it as a new CSV file. We will be needing a file path to store this CSV file, I will need to give `folderName` + `fileName` without extension where this needs to be saved.
    <!-- border -->![Save As Workbook](30-SaveAsWorkbook.png)

16. Finally we need to include **Close Excel Instance** to conclude the step
    <!-- border -->![Add Close Instance](31-AddCloseExcelInstance.png)

17. You can save the project and test it to validate the result.
    <!-- border -->![Run the project to test and validate](32-ValidationResult.png)

18. In the end, when this tutorial was tested, we used this below source data
    <!-- border -->![Source Excel Data](33-OriginalExcelData.png)

19. After Automaton is executed, it has filtered the data (Town starting with a), hide a column (Column F with title `storey_range`) and resultant excel will look like this
